## Description

Pac-Man Extreme is an enhanced browser-based version of the classic Pac-Man arcade game. Built using pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, this game features multiple levels, mobile touch controls, and an innovative "Trash Compactor" mode that adds a unique twist to the traditional gameplay.

## Approach and Methodology

As a group we opted to design a simple game, after research into various options, we settled on designing
a pac-man clone. Browser games are often made using canvas, and as we were unfamiliar with the technology
we found a simple tutorial to build a game engine in pure JavaScript. We each completed the tutorial to 
achieve a shared understanding of how the code operates, and then proceeded to enhance and expand the game.

To achieve this we identified user preferences through "user-stories", split the functionality required to speed up development. Utilizing one hour sprints, with stand ups organized over Discord to update progress. Once each feature was complete it was then integrated into the code-base. In this way we were able to add several features to the basic operation, and provide a good user experience.

## Enhanced Features

* Popup instructions modal to save space on mobile devices 
* Hidden mobile touch controls
* Three separate levels, with unique maps and colorschemes
* Lives system to complement the increased game length
* Compactor mode to add another dimension to play

## Technologies Used

AI was used mainly for the CSS styling outside of the game, and occasionally to fix broken game logic, or assist with errors introduced via merge conflicts. As building a game of this scope is ambitious, we all completed the same starter tutorial to achieve a shared understanding of how the internal logic is constructed. This approach meant we could more easily build working features ourselves to minimize use of AI, and integrate them with full understanding of their operation.

## Validation and Testing

### Passes Lighthouse Checks and Validation

## Further Development

* Obviously as this game is made in pure JavaScript, further development would be to rebuild the game in Canvas and refine the 90's styling
* Add sound effects and background music
* Implement high score system with local storage
* Add more ghost AI behaviors and difficulty levels
* Create additional power-ups and game mechanics
